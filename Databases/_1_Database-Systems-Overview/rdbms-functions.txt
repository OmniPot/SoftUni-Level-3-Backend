Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS data is structured in database tables, fields and records. Each RDBMS table consists of database table rows. Each database table row consists of one or more database table fields. 
RDBMS store the data into collection of tables, which might be related by common fields (database table columns). RDBMS also provide relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the database tables. Most RDBMS use SQL as database query language.
Edgar Codd introduced the relational database model. Many modern DBMS do not conform to the Coddâ€™s definition of a RDBMS, but nonetheless they are still considered to be RDBMS.
The most popular RDBMS are MS SQL Server, DB2, Oracle and MySQL.
